A simple script for getting files (mainly photos, videos) from several source directories and copying them into one destination directory renaming them consistently. 
The new filenames are based on the last modification date and time.

My main use case is taking photos on vacations using several devices and then I'd like to have an easy way to review them in the proper order to choose the best ones.

Prerequisites:
- devices' date and time should be synchronized :)

How to use:
- set SOURCE_DIR_PATHS - the list of source directories to lookup for files
- set DESTINATION_DIR_PATH - destination directory for all files
- just run the script
