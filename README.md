Simple script for getting files (mainly photos, videos) from several source directories and copying them into one destination directory renaming them consistently. 
The new filenames are based on last modification date and time.

My main use case is taking photos on vacations using several devices and then I'd like to have an easy way to review them in proper order to choose the best ones.

Prerequisities:
- devices' date and time should be synchronised :)
